# Process Log — Session Reporting & Persistence

## 2025-09-16T01:05:00Z — Kickoff
- Objective: persist the living report generated by the reasoning engine and expose an export flow (Markdown) on demand.
- Plan:
  1. Add report manager in main process that listens to reasoning updates and writes `report.json` + `report.md` using templates.
  2. Expose IPC for manual export (`export-report`) from renderer.
  3. Hook UI button to trigger export, confirm success, and provide quick access path.

## 2025-09-16T01:25:00Z — Live report persistence and export
- Added `ReportManager` in `main.js` to mirror reasoning updates into `JobData/sessions/<session>/report.json` and render Markdown via `report.md`.
- Implemented `export-report` IPC so the renderer can trigger a manual export; main window now includes an `Export Report` control (disabled until a session starts).
- Renderer syncs report preview with reasoning state and surfaces success/error toasts via alerts.
