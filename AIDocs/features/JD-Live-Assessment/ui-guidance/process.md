# Process Log — UI Integration & Guidance

## 2025-09-16T00:35:00Z — Kickoff
- Goal: surface reasoning/evidence outputs in the existing UI with minimal new styling.
- Plan:
  1. Add JD fit badge in status row and transcript annotations with current stats.
  2. Implement guidance queue panel (reuse existing styles) to show follow-up prompts.
  3. Render living report summary panel fed by reasoning state.
  4. Ensure teardown/reset on session end.

## 2025-09-16T00:55:00Z — UI scaffolding
- Extended `index.html` with JD fit badge, guidance queue, and live report panes while reusing existing styling.
- Renderer now tracks reasoning/guidance state, updates status badge colours, renders prompt queue and report summaries, and resets them on JD/session changes.
- Hooked reasoning/guidance IPC events into rendering pipeline; still logging raw payloads for debugging.
