Senior Full-Stack Engineer (Real-Time AI Platforms)
Company: InsightLoop.ai
Location: Hybrid (San Francisco, CA)
Type: Full-time

About the Role
We’re building a real-time interview intelligence platform that scores candidates against live Job Descriptions. You’ll own end-to-end delivery of features that ingest JD inputs, run streaming analysis, and surface actionable insights to our users.

Key Responsibilities

Design, build, and maintain Electron/Node.js features that capture JD inputs, stream telemetry, and write persistent reports.
Implement high-performance data pipelines that transform audio transcripts into structured evidence in near-real time.
Integrate OpenAI Realtime/Responses/Embeddings APIs with strong attention to reliability, rate limits, and security compliance.
Collaborate with product and design to deliver intuitive workflows using existing UI components (minimal new styling).
Establish automated testing and monitoring to ensure production readiness for long-running interview sessions.
Mentor team members and participate in architecture reviews.
Must-Have Qualifications

5+ years building production full-stack applications (JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js, Electron, React or similar).
Proven experience with streaming or real-time data processing (web sockets, event queues, backpressure management).
Hands-on integration experience with large language model APIs (OpenAI or equivalent) in production.
Strong foundations in secure file handling, sandboxing, and IPC patterns.
Excellent communication skills and ability to document plans/process in collaborative environments.
Nice-to-Have

Experience with Marketo, Greenhouse, or other HR tech integrations.
Familiarity with Markdown report generation, NDJSON event logs, and analytics pipelines.
Background in conversational AI, speech transcription, or voice UX.
What Success Looks Like (First 90 Days)

Deliver JD ingestion + requirement extraction subsystem with persisted metadata and embeddings.
Implement evidence tracker capable of replaying interview transcripts into structured events.
Collaborate with the reasoning team to ship a “live coaching” beta that surfaces prompts with <3s latency.
Establish observability dashboards tracking pipeline health, API errors, and cost metrics.
Use this as a “test JD” whenever you need to feed the new JD ingestion/scoring flows.
