They provided detailed examples of how they architected robust real-time data processing pipelines, including handling backpressure, serializing data formats like Markdown and NDJSON, and ensuring memory-leak free long-running sessions with clear tracing. Additionally, they discussed integrating with the OpenAI API to enable real-time responses and embeddings, and implementing caching and rate limiting strategies. This aligns extremely well with the key technical requirements for the role, and the candidate has clearly mastered these critical areas.
