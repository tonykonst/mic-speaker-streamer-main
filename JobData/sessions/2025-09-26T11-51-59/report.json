They provided specific examples of implementing robust technical solutions, such as handling backpressure, securing Electron apps, and integrating with OpenAI APIs. Their responses indicate a strong grasp of enterprise-grade software engineering practices, including caching embeddings and monitoring rate limits to ensure reliable performance.
