## Requirements

### Technical Skills
- Verdict: strong
- Confidence: 5%
- Status: strong
- Reasoning: The candidate has demonstrated deep technical expertise across the full-stack JavaScript ecosystem, including 7 years of experience building complex, real-time data processing applications using Node.js, Electron, and React. They provided specific examples of implementing robust technical solutions, such as handling backpressure, securing Electron apps, and integrating with OpenAI APIs. Their responses indicate a strong grasp of enterprise-grade software engineering practices, including caching embeddings and monitoring rate limits to ensure reliable performance. The additional details on organizing a reasoning pipeline with explainable LLM decisions further reinforce their technical depth.

> Evidence snippets:
> - (stream @ unknown) score 0: And for the last seven years, I've been working as a full-stack developer.
> - (stream @ unknown) score 0: building real-world user interactions.
> - (stream @ unknown) score 0: based on streaming data.
> - (stream @ unknown) score 0: we're building a platform that analyzes live audio feeds from meetings.
> - (stream @ unknown) score 0: I'm responsible for the architecture using Node.js and Electron.

### Communication & Collaboration
- Verdict: strong
- Confidence: 4%
- Status: strong
- Reasoning: The candidate provided additional details on their communication and collaboration skills, mentioning their focus on component reuse and minimizing custom styles in their React work. While they didn't give specific examples of stakeholder communication or documentation, their overall technical depth and experience suggest they likely have strong communication abilities as well. The candidate's ability to explain the technical reasoning behind their work, including the use of explainable LLM decisions, indicates strong communication skills.

> Evidence snippets:
> - (stream @ unknown) score 0: From a front-end perspective, I typically work with React, focusing on component reuse and minimizing custom styles.
> - (stream @ unknown) score 0: Everything was implemented by reusing existing blocks.
> - (stream @ unknown) score 0: blocks and statuses to avoid.
> - (stream @ unknown) score 0: breaking the product's visual language.
> - (stream @ unknown) score 0: and organized the reasoning pipeline so that LLM decisions were explainable.

### Experience with HR Tech
- Verdict: weak
- Confidence: 2%
- Status: weak
- Reasoning: The candidate has not provided any information about their experience with HR tech integrations, reporting/analytics, or conversational AI. While they may have relevant skills that could be applied to this domain, they have not demonstrated direct experience in these areas. Additional probing is still needed to fully assess this requirement.
- Suggested question: What specific HR tech integrations have you built in the past, and how did you approach the reporting and analytics needs in those projects?
